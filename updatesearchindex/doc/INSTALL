Installing updatesearchindex extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf updatesearchindex-0_0_1.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip updatesearchindex-0_0_1.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=updatesearchindex

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=updatesearchindex

4. Configuration

   We must now configuration updatesearchindex

   You will need to edit the updatesearchindex.ini file and customize as needed.
   Alternately you may create an override copy of this file.

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/updatesearchindex.ini.append(.php)

   Note:
   ==============================
   In most cases you must only change the SearchSiteAccess variable to match the name of your site's primary siteaccess
